<h1>Hiya, friends!</h1>
<img src="https://smlavine.com/images/rosie.jpg" alt="A picture of Rosie."/>
<h2>My name is Rosie, and this is my website.</h2>
<p>
As you can see, this website is 
<small><strong><em>awesome</em></strong></small>.
I do my own thing, and I sleep for half the day, so this is what you get.
It's almost as pretty as me.
</p>
<p>
I am a fluffball from Buffalo, New York.
I have a passion for
<a href="https://www.cesarsway.com/dog-approved-people-food/">
  eating</a> and chasing after nothing.
Next year, I will be here. Still.
</p>
<p>
I also enjoy barking and eating out of the garbage.
I have been lucky enough to eat out of the garbage can a
<small><strong><em>lot</em></strong></small> of times, and I am participating in
the 2020 Running-Around-In-Circles-In-The-Yard. I don't like to be in charge of
things. Lots of people are scary and I have to protect my people from them.
