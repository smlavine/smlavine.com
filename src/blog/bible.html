<p>Here are some pictures of a little King James Bible I got at a thrift store a
few years ago for a dollar.</p>

<p>I'm not religious. I've only read up through Genesis. In the front, there's
the name of the address of a girl who got it for her birthday in the 1930's. I
looked on Google Maps, but the house has been demolished.</p>

<p>I like that the illustrations are so vibrant. Others would know more about
this than me, but I think I prefer the text of the KJV as opposed to more modern
translations. It just feels more... <i>Bible-y</i>, you know?</p>
