      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, 2021, I felt that it had been the best year of
my life yet. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a helpful chart to illustrate the highs and lows of my year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/2022.png&quot; alt=&quot;A volatile chart, entitled &amp;quot;2022: A subjective, emotionally biased look back&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year of immense change. Who I lived with, where I lived, who
I spent time with, who I worked with. It forced me to examine who I am
at my core. What do I actually want to do with my life? Am I happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminiscing like this at the end of the year, looking bad at all of
those dips in that chart, makes me feel like it was just a sucky year
with no redeeming qualities. But that isn't true at all! The lows were
the lowest I have ever experienced. But with some luck, they'll stay
that way. I am very grateful for what I've got. I'm surrounded by some
of the smartest, funniest, nicest, hardest-working people I know. I've
got a new baby cousin. I've learned a lot, and I've still got a lot of
life left to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it all, 2022 was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodmoviefilm.com&quot;&gt;good moviefilm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023 will be a year of opportunity. By the end of it, I will only have
one semester of classes left before I graduate. I will have completed
one semester of a co-op and I will be getting ready for two more. It's
kind of sad, actually, just how fast this time is flying by. Yes, it's
stressful, but so is the rest of the world. Never again in my life will
I be surrounded by so many friends, or by so many clubs and people with
whom I share interests. I'm going to live to the fullest while I still
can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really have no clue at all what my life will look like a year from
now. But to the person I know is reading this on December 31, 2023:
I hope it all turned out okay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Syncthing</title>
      <link>https://smlavine.com/blog/syncthing</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://smlavine.com/blog/syncthing</guid>
      <author>Sebastian LaVine</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now I've wanted to set up Syncthing to sync music and
schoolwork between my laptop and my desktop. Getting it up and running was as
simple as &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -Syu syncthing&lt;/code&gt; on my two computers,
following &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;this
guide&lt;/a&gt;, and clicking a few buttons. Easy! The few bits of configuration I
did in the GUI are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabled password login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typed in my desktop's device ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played around with the Default Folder to make sure that it was working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the folders I wanted -- &lt;code&gt;Documents/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Media/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed my devices to share those folders with each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it. It started syncing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started and enabled the systemd service to have Syncthing start up
automatically on my laptop, but it used a bit too much CPU for me to
have it running all the time on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else I noticed is that the firefox running the web GUI was
eating up a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of memory and CPU on my laptop -- much more so than
Syncthing itself. Of course, the syncing happens fine without that
happening, so that shouldn't be too big of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/syncthing/webgui.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the Syncthing web GUI. There are two columns: on the left, one labeled &amp;quot;Folders (2)&amp;quot; lists &amp;quot;Documents&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Media&amp;quot;. Media is &amp;quot;Up to Date&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;Documents&amp;quot; is still &amp;quot;Syncing (94%, 543 MiB)&amp;quot;. On the right, the column is labeled &amp;quot;This Device&amp;quot; and lists information about the device &amp;quot;archlinux-x220&amp;quot;: Download Rate, Upload Rate, Local State (showing ~85.3 GiB of data), and other diagnostic information. Below that section is a section labeled &amp;quot;Remote Devices&amp;quot; showing that &amp;quot;archlinux-white&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;Up to Date&amp;quot;.&quot; title=&quot;Syncing in progress.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I turned to syncing music with my Android phone. I installed
Syncthing through [F-Droid][fdroid], and a few taps later, I was ready
to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem is that my media library is very large -- more than 75GB.
But I really only want a subset of this available on my phone: my
favorite music. So, I created a Syncthing Folder of the subdirectory
&lt;code&gt;Media/music/mine&lt;/code&gt;, which is much smaller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; j mine
/home/sebastian/Media/music/mine
&lt;span class=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; dh
4.0K    ./.stfolder
8.0K    ./.thumbnails
39M     ./The Seatbelts
49M     ./Chali 2na
51M     ./Valve Studio Orchestra
60M     ./C2C
68M     ./Tally Hall
95M     ./Toby Fox
106M    ./Lin-Manuel Miranda
119M    ./Parov Stelar
172M    ./Ghost
174M    ./Charlotte Church
184M    ./Hideki Naganuma
196M    ./Gustav Holst
198M    ./Queen
205M    ./Spiralmouth
229M    ./George Gershwin
258M    ./Django Reinhardt
287M    ./Camelot
390M    ./Tchaikovsky
396M    ./Yes
488M    ./Lemaitre
496M    ./ABBA
1.2G    ./Caravan Palace
8.8G    ./The Beatles
15G     .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm. The Beatles are still taking up a lot of space, because they are in
FLAC. Anything else I can do about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; cd The\ Beatles
&lt;span class=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; dh
182M    ./Love
8.7G    ./The Beatles - Stereo and Mono Box Sets + Extras [FLAC]
8.8G    .
&lt;span class=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; cd The\ Beatles\ -\ Stereo\ and\ Mono\ Box\ Sets\ +\ Extras\ \[FLAC\]/
&lt;span class=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; dh
2.0G    ./Extras
2.5G    ./The Beatles in Mono
4.3G    ./The Beatles Stereo Box Set
8.7G    .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see. Well, I don't really need both the Mono &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Stereo sets on my
phone. Syncthing makes it simple to exlude a particular file or
directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/syncthing/ignore.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the Syncthing web GUI, showing a popup allowing us to &amp;quot;Edit Folder (Media/music/mine)&amp;quot;. In the center of the window is a field for ignore patterns, labelled &amp;quot;Enter ignore patterns, one per line.&amp;quot; In the field has been entered the path to the Beatles Mono set. Below that are some instructions on how to use a subset of regex to match patterns.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is small enough to squeeze onto my phone's microSD card. I scan the
QR code of my desktop's device ID, and the devices pair. I check a box
to share &lt;code&gt;Media/music/mine&lt;/code&gt; with my phone, and after accepting a popup
and telling Syncthing Android where to put the folder, it begins
syncing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/syncthing/android.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the Syncthing Android app. It shows that syncing of Media/music/mine is 11% complete. The app's interface is simple and clean.&quot; title=&quot;The Android app is very simple to use.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased with using Syncthing so far. I look forward to
potentially using it to sync other data I have, like uncommitted code
between my laptop and desktop, or photos between my phone and computers.
Have you used Syncthing? I'd love to hear your experiences with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt;: After finishing this post, I noticed that three random music
files were not syncing properly. I tried adding new files, checking for
free space, restarting Syncthing on both my phone and my computer, but
still, these particular files would not sync. I &amp;quot;solved&amp;quot; the problem by
adding them to my list of files to ignore for syncing, since luckily
these weren't particular important music files to me. But the issue
does raises concern over the tool's reliability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>KJV Bible pictures</title>
      <link>https://smlavine.com/blog/bible</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures of a little King James Bible I got at a thrift store a
few years ago for a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/bible/kjv01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of me holding the Bible in my hand. It is about the height of a smartphone, and maybe a bit wider. It is a beat-up, dirty black leather. At the top of the book, in muted, cursive gold text, it reads, &amp;quot;Holy Bible Illustrated&amp;quot;.&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/bible/kjv02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Bible is open to its first page. On the left page is a color illustration of &amp;quot;Abraham&amp;apos;s Oak&amp;quot;. The colors are bright, almost like watercolors. There are figures gathered around the bottom of the tree. On the right page is an old-looking copyright page that reads in all-caps, &amp;quot;The Holy Bible, Containing The Old &amp;amp; New Testaments, Translated Out Of The Original Tongues And With The Former Translations Diligently Compared And Revised By His Majesty&amp;apos; Special Command, (in italics)Appointed To Be Read In Churches&amp;quot;. The logo for Oxford University is printed. Then, the text continues, &amp;quot;Oxford, At The University Press; London: Humphrey Milford, Amen House, E.C.4, New York And Toronto&amp;quot;.&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/bible/kjv03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Bible is open to pages 31 and 32. You can see that the pages have a red outline on their edges. On the left page is Genesis 31, in two columns. The text is very small. On the right page is an illustration titled &amp;quot;Women Drawing Water At A Well&amp;quot;. It is in the same style as the previous illustration. It depicts three women it loose white robes, smiling and carrying water. There are plants around them. In the background appears to be a small pond, and a desert hill.&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/bible/kjv04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Bible is open to pages further into the book. On the left page is II. Chronicles 29, in the same style as the previous photo. On the right page is an illustration titled &amp;quot;Jaffa; Or, &amp;quot;Fish Gate&amp;quot;&amp;quot;. It is in the same style as before. In the foreground is a big sandstone castle with a white flag above it. There is an open gate, and people are walking in and out, and gathering around. There are two dilapidated market stands against the walls of the castle. A man travels by on a camel. The illustration is detailed enough to make out that these are people, and to see generally what they are doing, but not enough to make out any more personal details. The sky is blue.&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://smlavine.com/images/bible/kjv05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Bible is open to the last page. Unlike the previous pages, it is open horizontally. It shows a colored map of modern-day Egypt, Israel, and surrounding regions, centered on the Sinai Peninsula. The title of the map reads &amp;quot;The Peninsula Of Sinai and adjacent lands, to illustrate the Migration of the Israelites from EGYPT to CANAAN&amp;quot;. The picture is slightly blurry, making it hard to read all of the text detailing various cities and points of interest on the map. The map appears to list both where modern-day cities are located, as well as where different groups of people are thought to have lived at some point; for example, the Nile Delta is labeled with &amp;quot;Land of Ham&amp;quot;. The Mediterranean Sea is labeled as &amp;quot;The Great Sea&amp;quot;. There are latitude lines labeled from 28 to 32, and longitude lines from 29 to 37.&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not religious. I've only read up through Genesis. In the front, there's
the name of the address of a girl who got it for her birthday in the 1930's. I
looked on Google Maps, but the house has been demolished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that the illustrations are so vibrant. Others would know more about
this than me, but I think I prefer the text of the KJV as opposed to more modern
        translations. It just feels more... &lt;i&gt;Bible-y&lt;/i&gt;, you know?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
