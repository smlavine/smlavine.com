I've been hanging around the [Modal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/modal)
language project the last week or so and it's been a lot of fun. I made
the following video to show another contributor how to submit changes to
the reference implementation through the SourceHut web UI. Hope it's
useful! Excuse the umms and ahhs and the buzzing in the background.
